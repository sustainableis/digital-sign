# SIS Digital Signage

These files are a collection of softward, data and documentation related to SIS' digital sign system.

## Hardware and Overview

The current system is designed around the Zotac ZBox-ID41 mini-pc.

The Zotac needs to have a 4GB DIMM installed, then we mount and boot from an SD card 
containing a customized version of Knoppix Linux to provide the OS.  The sign itself
runs as a web page displayed in Iceweasel (aka Firefox) running in kiosk mode.
